                        <p>Playing Pretend in the Interim is bold, playful, and the new Reese you never imagined. It is a five-track EP of songs completed during isolation. This is both a writing experiment and an examination of the self as a human living with and for others. She wrote these songs from different perspectives and characters (an encyclopedia salesman, a long-gone celebrity, a haunting ghost...) - seeing hyper-specific experiences with borrowed eyes. Itâ€™s a combination of research, imagination, secondhand stories, histories, and things she's heard and witnessed along the way. This EP is a way of escaping reality for a moment, allowing room for wonder and play.</p>

                        <p>Lansangan has acknowledged that books and reading play a big part of her life, and a big influence on her art. During a holiday in the US in 2015, she started a personal tradition she refers to as the #ArigatoInternetHunt, where she hides copies of her album in various books, for strangers to find. She turned the tradition into an official promotion event, working with the Philippine bookstore chain Fully Booked (which she referred to as her "favorite bookstore.") in 2017.</p>
